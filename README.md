A fake New site that I made with my studies friend Liel Buhnik. using HTML, CSS, Jquery and Type Script. 

The script begins by initializing variables and defining functions. It then uses an AJAX request to fetch data from a JSON file containing articles. For each article, it creates HTML elements representing news posts and appends them to the appropriate sections on the page. Additionally, it updates the main post section with the first article's data and sets the background and text color based on the article type.

Furthermore, there's a function for displaying notifications at regular intervals and another function for handling the display of full articles when clicked. This function retrieves the selected article name from local storage, fetches the article data, and displays it on a separate page while playing a page turn sound effect.
